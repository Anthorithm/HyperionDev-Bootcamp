# Build Your Brand 01 Project

Practical Task 1 Summary:

For "Build Your Brand 01," the first task involved creating a Google document with a uniquely identifiable filename containing your name, email address, and task identifier (BYB1). The document would serve as a platform to document your progress and responses throughout the practical tasks.

The main focus of this task was to envision oneself as a successful entrepreneur in the tech industry and articulate how the skills and knowledge gained from the bootcamp could be applied to acquire self-employment or entrepreneurial opportunities. Specifically, the task required:

   1. Identifying the skills and knowledge acquired or to be acquired during the bootcamp, as outlined in the bootcamp syllabus.

   2. Crafting a detailed plan (200 - 400 words) outlining a self-employment or entrepreneurial opportunity. This plan should include specific examples of projects, freelance work, or entrepreneurial ventures where the skills learned in the bootcamp would be applied effectively.

For example, one could mention specific programming languages learned in the bootcamp (e.g., Python) and how they enable opportunities in contract development roles, freelance work, or entrepreneurial ventures in the tech industry.

Practical Task 2 Summary:

The second pratical task involved finding two suitable junior tech roles currently being advertised. This required considering a range of employers, including large companies, small companies, tech scale-ups, and internships/apprenticeships.

1. For each role found, the task required identifying the recruiting/hiring managers (often Talent or HR personnel) and collecting their contact details, including email, phone number, and LinkedIn profile URL.

2. Additionally, screenshots of the completed form containing the contact details were to be taken and pasted into the Google document created in Practical Task 1. The completed Google document was then saved as a PDF and uploaded to Dropbox.

Overall, the Build Your Brand 01 project aimed to enhance skills in job searching, networking, and articulating one's career goals and aspirations within the tech industry.
