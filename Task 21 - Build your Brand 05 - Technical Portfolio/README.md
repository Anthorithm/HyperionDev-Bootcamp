# Build Your Brand 05 Project

For "Build Your Brand 05," the assignment primarily involved setting up a GitHub repository, creating and tracking changes to a simple program, and pushing the repository to GitHub. Here are the steps I followed:

### Compulsory Task 1: 

1. **Creating a Google Doc**: 
   - Begin by creating a Google doc with a filename including your name, email address, and task identifier (BYB5). This document will serve as your workspace to record progress and answers.

2. **GitHub Setup**:
   - Login to GitHub using the account created in a previous task.
   - Create a new repository named "byb_project" and ensure it is public.

3. **Local Setup**:
   - Create an empty folder named "byb_project" on your local machine.
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the newly created folder.
   - Initialise a Git repository using the command `git init`.
   - Check the status of the repository using `git status` to ensure a clean working directory.

4. **File Creation and Tracking**:
   - Create a new file named `helloWorld.py` or `helloWorld.js` (for Python or JavaScript, respectively) in the "byb_project" folder.
   - Write a program in the file to print "Hello World!".
   - Check the status again with `git status` to confirm the untracked status of the file.
   - Add the file to the staging area using `git add helloWorld.py`.
   - Verify the status with `git status` to ensure the file is tracked and staged for commit.
   - Modify the file to print "Git is Awesome!" and check the status once more.

5. **Committing Changes**:
   - Stage the modified file again with `git add helloWorld.py`.
   - Commit the changes using `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.
   - Confirm a clean working directory with `git status`.

6. **Pushing to GitHub**:
   - Navigate to the "byb_project" folder in your terminal.
   - Add the remote repository with `git remote add [remote-name] [url]`.
   - Push the local repository to GitHub using `git push -u [remote-name] master`.

### Compulsory Task 2:

1. **Creating a 2nd repository**:
   - Create a remote repository named "finalCapstone".
   - Push the last Capstone Project and any previous ones you would like to include.
   - Add a descriptive README.md for each project to help visitors understand it. 
   - Make the repository public.

### Compulsory Task  3:

1. **Creating a 3rd repository**:
   - Create a repository with the name spelt exactly as your Github username.
   - Add a README.md inside the newly created repository and use it as a landing page for your Github account.  
   - Design your landing page with Github styling, including images and text styles.

2. **Updating profiles**:
   - Add your Github link to your LinkedIn profile. 
   - Share your LinkedIn profile link inside your google doc.
   - Update your personal CV/résumé by adding your Github profile and other relevant links.
   - Take a screenshot of your CV/résumé change and paste it within your Google answers doc.

2. **Identifying contacts**: 
   - Locate recruiting or hiring managers for each role and obtain their contact details, including email addresses for at least two individuals and LinkedIn profile URLs for all.

3. **Submitting applications**: 
   - Create and submit applications for the identified job opportunities. Also, reach out to contacts identified through email, LinkedIn direct message, phone call, etc., to draw their attention to your application.

4. **Tracking applications**: 
   - Utilise the provided template spreadsheet to track applications. Fill in details of the contact people into a form as well.

5. **Documenting and Submission**:
   - Fill in a form with information about the employer and job link application for each job. 
   - Include screenshots of the form inside the Google doc.
